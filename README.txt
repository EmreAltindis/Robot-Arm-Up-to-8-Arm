In this study, the aim was to perform kinematic analysis up to an 8-DOF robot arm using a GUI developed in Matlab/App Designer. Text blocks were used for manual input followed by sliders and spinners for making necessary adjustments. Additionally, radio buttons were added to control whether each joint is revolute or prismatic. The results of kinematic analyses are saved in a text file, and end-effector position information is displayed on the GUI. A representative robot position visual is also plotted on the Matlab plot screen.
